# AI-for-Earth

# Overview 
The key idea of the project is to use ArcGIS for GIS model and AI analytics to model and calculate the most optimized cultivating area, based on (currently is prototype for Thailand area only)worldwide cultivated area references data, the optimum output will support people or farmer planning, making decision and managing or prototyping their crops to achieve the goal of carbon absorption efficiency as needed.

# Steps
1. Prepare the Soil boundary data that have soil ID as the initial data
2. Prepare the plant table that has Soil ID to be able to realize the suggested plant name and the suggested Soil ID for planting.
3. Mapping step (with python script): Adding the suggested plant name to the original Soil boundary data and suggestion plant table with suggested soil ID, but both data must have soil ID 
After mapping, when we view the data, if we get more than one suggests plant, the data will separate with a comma.
